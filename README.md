# BetterShadows
Lets you tweak the shadow cascade distance for the shadowmap in ffxiv. Additionally, lets you change the 2048p shadowmap resolution to 4096p.

To use this plugin, install it from the official dalamud repository, or add http://repo.modloader64.com/ffxiv/plugins.json to your list of plugin repositories.

## Default Preset and Preset Inheritance
To simplify the usage of presets, and presets in zones, and subzones, I made presets inherit from their parent. If a preset has no parent, it will instead use the preset that you set as the default preset.
