# BetterShadows
Lets you tweak the shadow cascade distance for the shadowmap in ffxiv

To use this plugin, add http://repo.modloader64.com/ffxiv/plugins.json to your list of plugin repositories.

# Presets
You can save presets based on values you like for certain scenarios. The plugin ships with a couple default presets:

## Long Distance
This preset balances the shadow quality over a very long distance. This basically only looks good on Mare Lamentorum.

## Balanced
Similar to how the game treats many areas. Fairly detailed close up, not very detailed in the distance.

## Detailed
Sacrifices shadow distance for shadow quality. Shadows will notably fade out, however, the ones you do see will look sharp.

## Seamless
Similar to detailed, however extends the range just enough so that the cascades appear seamless.

## Compromise
Compromises some close up detail, and further away detail so that shadows appear somewhat detailed, and at a distance.
